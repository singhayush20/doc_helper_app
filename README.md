## Subscription feature

Things required-
1. Enhance existing setup to add more restrictions like - limited number of docs.
2. If user runs out of tokens, user must not be able to upload/chat. (Chat/doc upload interfaces must show these indicators)
3. Provide robust system for user to update the account type to upgrade to pro or cancel the subscription.
4. Payment Feature
5. In the chat page, restrict only to only localized questions and not whole document summary. Make a premium feature for doc summarizer.
